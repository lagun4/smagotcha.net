By the end of the year I officially registered the project at my university to collect a bunch of credit points. I already had thought about different ideas to bring the concept to maturity. Sometimes it happened that what I initially thought would work proved wrong so certain aspects continually needed to be worked over. I was more than grateful once the team was fully gathered and ready to clarify what is actually possible to implement and what not. But until then weeks and months had passed and it was a real struggle to get together all these voluntarily working people without salaries being involved. My offer to them was a common vision and a work space that welcomes and encourages listening genuinely to each other.

In summer 2018 I had asked a friend of mine, Jana, if she wants to join to help with the website and the logo design. She has been there from the very beginning and has also been the crucial assistance in managing the project. It was her whose idea I embraced to bring light into the creature. 

Soon after, I started looking for a programmer to code the app. I sent out tons of emails and asked many different people. After months of searching I was finally recommended Zsombor who is experienced in programming for smartphone applications for iOS. It turned out he both identifies with healthy smartphone usage and mindfulness.

Mette followed our team in a time when it became clearer that we need a separate 3D designer. She is able to envision and model what I call the substance of the project: The creature that must evolve throughout the game. With her many years of experience in working with 3D she has guided other teams in their creative processes. We got to know each other through my internship and later worked again together for an advertisement clip. 

At last a fellow student of mine, Rigo, has joined the team. He has been part in projects for different smartphone games and will be the sound designer of our team now. We all welcome him to the core team. He is studying the post degree called "Sound and Reality".

We still look for somebody to further develop our current website. If you feel this project could be something for you please send us an email. We would be more than happy!

Now, we want this project to work: We are going to build a platform that encourages a critical use of ones smartphone. We elegantly guide the user away from it by offering a personal avatar. The avatar directs the user's attention through sounds and text.
