By the end of the year I had collected many ideas about how I want to go about a project that I called Smagotcha. I had asked Jana if she wants to join in to help design the website, the logo and the creature. I knew Jana is a splendid listener so I also asked her if she wants to assist me in managing the project. I wanted somebody who I could tell my conceptual thoughts out loud. It can be very isolating to think the concept back and forth. I am very grateful for all the hours in which Jana has already listened to my ideas and for her feedback.

I officially registered the project at my university to collect a bunch of credit points within my "music and media" degree. I started working on the concept, met different people, professors and PR departments of potential investors. 

My first attempt to get a scholarship from my own university failed. I admit the whole idea was still very general and for some sceptical folks in the jury the concept must have sounded very ambitious if not totally absurd. When one of the dear jury members had to silence down her ringing phone when I just started pitching Smagotcha I was very hopeful that this was the perfect start to bring about my message. So I was even more surprised that my message didn't seem to ring through. 

Thanks to Jana that we got our first financial support of 750 Euros out of partial scholarship from her university. It wasn't much but it helped to pay her journey from Austria to Germany where we could finally meet to work next to one another. We had a wonderfully productive 3 days in Duesseldorf. We applied for a German patent for the name Smagotcha and got ourselves a nice dinner at "Space Burgers" to get spaced out the next day.

A few weeks later I had contacted about 120 health insurance companies for further financial support. I felt highly motivated when I received all that positive feedback from their marketing departments. And it was a great lesson in "how to pitch". Ultimately, out of 120 companies there were 5 who sent affiliates to have appointments with me. So I presented the project in detail for potential cooperations. 

Initially most of them were interested in exclusive usage. I sensed they wanted a more mature product almost ready for the market. They would have been insterested in full funding. Since we didn't have a presentable prototype at the time almost all of the them withdrew later on. Additionally, the current legal funding restrictions made it extra hard to hope for a sponsor out of this branch. Last standing was one remaining company who is offering a potential community to try out a soon to be released prototype. This company is already active in terms of the problems of digitalization and they already promote balanced screen time.  

From the very beginning of the project I kept looking for a programmer to code the app. I sent out tons of emails and spoke to many different people. I met an Irish guy in a bar who offered me his help but he dropped out when he realized it is too much work. I went to a jam session with my old flatmate where I talked to people until someone recommended a sincere and nice guy but he couldn't identify with our topic so he also dropped out. I went on a Couchsurfing meeting every sunday where I met a bunch of IT students and one girl recommended her sister from Dubai. I knew she's far away but I wanted to take that risk because what could I have lost? Just her of course... yea, she dropped out as well. Finally, I had a tinder date who recommended me Zsombor. Initially, I would have never expected this to work out... not after all this trouble and wasted energy. I must say, I was at the edge of giving up. 





...and why the name Smagotcha? Have you ever wondered why people's attention spans go down? Ask yourself how often it happens that you don't finish your intended tasks because you get distracted by your Sma...Gotcha! 

Didn't it?
