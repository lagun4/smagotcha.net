title: "Pitch Perfect"
---

Since the beginning of the project I kept applying for funding. My first attempt to get a scholarship from my own university wasn't a full success. I admit the whole idea was still very general and for some sceptical folks in the jury the idea must have sounded very ambitious if not totally absurd. It happened that one of the dear jury members had to silence down her ringing phone when I just started with Smagotcha. Hence, I was very hopeful that this could be the perfect pitch to bring about my message. Sadly, my message didn't seem to ring through. 

Thanks to Jana that we got our first financial support of 750 Euros out of partial scholarship from her university. It wasn't much but it helped to pay her journey from Austria to Germany where we could finally meet to work next to one another. We had a wonderfully productive 3 days in Duesseldorf. In the end we got ourselves a nice dinner at "Space Burgers" to get spaced out the next day. With the remaining money we paid to protect the name Smagotcha. The remaining money is just waiting to be spent. So far we have been cautious with our expenses. 

A few weeks later I had contacted about 120 health insurance companies for further financial support. I felt highly motivated when I received a lot of positive feedback from their marketing departments. And it was a great lesson in pitching. Ultimately, out of 120 companies there were a handful of them who sent affiliates to have appointments with me. So I presented the project in detail for potential cooperations. 

Initially most of them were interested in exclusive usage. I sensed they wanted a more mature product almost ready for the market. I sensed they were insterested in full funding. Since we didn't have a presentable prototype at the time most of them withdrew later on. Additionally, the current legal funding restrictions made it hard to hope for a sponsor from the health sector. Last standing was one remaining company who is still offering a their potential customers and clients to try out a soon to be released prototype. This company is already aware of the problems of digitalization. They seem to be one of the few who see the urgency of stabilizing attention rates. The Center for Humane Technology has long been a signpost in terms of re-designing our digital tools. Humans have suffered at a market where its traders primary focus is our attention. 

Have you ever wondered why people's attention spans go down? Ask yourself how often it happens that you don't finish your intended tasks because you get distracted by your Sma...Gotcha! 

Didn't it?
