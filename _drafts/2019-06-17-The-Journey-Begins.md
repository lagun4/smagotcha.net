title: "The Journey Begins"
---

So far I have often been alone on my journeys arounds the world. This time I will bring a little friend with me.

In August and September 2019 I'm gonna travel with Smagotcha through Europe. We will agree to be picked up by travellers of all kinds and especially those who want to join our community as both donors or followers.

Alright then! Let's get ready for standing and waiting, eagerly stretching our thumbs into the wind and proudly presenting our wonderful sign. There's no fixed destination yet. We want to be led by fortune and those people who are willing to pick up me and my little friend. May they listen to our story.

In order to create a bit of confusion and thereby to arouse the interest of the many drivers I decided to put the Smagotcha logo onto the sign instead of merely writing the next best city destination on it.

Fully equipped we gonna hitch our way through, however, there will be a few rules:

*-> Every time when a driver pulls over, I will explain the project Smagotcha briefly. We will only hop on if the driver is interested in further listening. In case of an emergency e.g. it becomes urgent to arrive in the next city or if I don't feel well, I would then look for the next best opportunity to get a ride.*

*-> As soon as we made ourselves comfortable on the seats, I will pitch the project. I don't want to distract the drivers so I will only talk until we have a break or when I'm released of the vehicle. If the driver agrees, I will take a photo of us that will be uploaded in a new blog post later.*

*-> I will always explain a few conditions for a decent place of arrival. Therefore it must be either:*
    *- a rest station on the highway*
    *- a city center*
*This way I am able to navigate ourselves depending on the time of the day wether we want to continue hitchhiking or look out for somewhere to sleep.* 

Accompany us on our adventure.

We wish you lots of fun reading this blog!
