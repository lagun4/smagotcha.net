In August 2017 I travelled through Portugal when one day my phone got hit by the ocean. I had been surfing in a tiny surfer's paradise called Arrifana close to the Algarve. Later, when I relaxed on the beach I didn't notice the high tide coming in. Before I could save my little bag and myself a wave had already destroyed my phone. Surprisingly, I didn't feel annoyed. I was perplex but there was as well sort of relief. 

The succeeding sixty days I continued travelling in Portugal and afterwards in Morocco. All without a phone. Sure, it wasn't always easy and there were times when I wished my phone back. But after all I noticed the many travellers who all seemed to me as if they were quite dependent on their gadgets. It usually happened that I entered a hostel lobby full of people yet those people were mostly by themselves. Deeply enchanted by their screens I felt I had never been able to see it that clear before. I assumed that the lack of my own smartphone must have made me more sensitive in this regard. Throughout my travels it then kept happening that I got surprised by human smartphone addiction.

In April 2018 I visited Vietnam for a one-month backpacking trip. During my journey I was again confronted by the many travelers who navigated themselves with their mobiles. I also relied on my own smartphone but this time I myself was among these hostel lobby guests who were all sitting next to each other so anonymously. It took a few hostels more to realize how comfortable I had felt the year before in Portugal when I didn't have a phone. 

I wanted to come up with something. How could people could use their smartphone more consciously? I like my smartphone so demonizing it would have been a deal breaker...
