title: "Why Smagotcha?"
---

In August 2017, I was travelling through Portugal when one day my phone got hit by the ocean! I had been surfing in a tiny surfing paradise called Arrifana, close to the Algarve. As I was relaxing on the beach, I didn't notice the high tide coming in – and before I could save my little bag and myself, a wave had already destroyed my phone. Surprisingly, I wasn't annoyed: I was perplexed, but there was also a sense of relief.

For the next 2 months I continued travelling through Portugal and then on to Morocco. All without a phone. It wasn't easy! And there were certainly times I wished I'd had my phone back. But then I began to notice the many travellers who all seemed as if they were quite dependent on their gadgets. It became a usual sight upon entering a hostel lobby full of people to see most of those people alone. Their focus was on their phones – something I hadn't been able to see so clearly until I had lost my own. Throughout my travels,<br> I increasingly became surprised by human smartphone addiction.

Months later, in April 2018 I visited Vietnam on a month-long backpacking trip. During my journey I was again confronted by the many travellers who navigated themselves with their mobiles. And I wasn't immune: I had fallen back into my old pattern of sitting in hostel lobbies full of people yet being an island unto myself – in a room full of travellers from all over the world! It wasn't until a few more hostels that I realized how truly relaxed I felt back in Portugal when I didn't have a phone.

So, I wanted to come up with something new. How could people use their smartphones more consciously? I like my smartphone and, truth be told, it's very useful, so demonizing it would have been a deal breaker...
