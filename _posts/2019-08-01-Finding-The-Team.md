title: "Finding the Team"
---

Every team has a beginning, and ours didn't just happen overnight. At the end of 2018 I officially registered Smagotcha at my university in order to earn credits. By then, I had already put a lot of thought into how to make it work. Sometimes, what I initially thought would work proved false and many aspects continually needed to change. Many weeks and months had passed and it was a real challenge to assemble a proper team without being able to offer financial compensation. The best I could offer was a common vision and a work space that encourages genuine listening to one another.

In summer 2018 I had asked a friend of mine, Jana, if she wants to join to help with the website and the logo design. She has been there from the very beginning and has also been the crucial assistance in managing the project. It was her whose idea I embraced to bring light into the creature. She recently managed to acquire our first sponsorship.

Soon after, I started looking for a programmer to code the app. I sent out tons of emails and asked many different people. After months of searching I was finally recommended Zsombor who is experienced in programming for smartphone applications for iOS. It turned out he both identifies with healthy smartphone usage and mindfulness. I am grateful how disciplined he is.

Mette followed our team in a time when it became clearer that we need a separate 3D designer. She is able to envision and model what I call the substance of the project: The creature that must evolve throughout the game. With her many years of experience in working with 3D she has guided other teams in their creative processes. We got to know each other through my internship at her old animation company and later worked again together for an advertisement clip. 

A fellow student of mine, Rigo, very recently joined the team as the sound designer. He has already been part in projects for several smartphone games. We all welcome him to the core team. He is studying the postgraduate "Sound and Reality".

Ultimately, Bj√∂rn, a friend of a friend got interested in helping us out with the website development. He is ambitious in taking up the challenge with us. 

...there is one more team member that I almost forgot... The avatar of course! Does it have a name? How would you call your little Smagotcha?
