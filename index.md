Imagine you possess a creature made of light, which gives you the opportunity to become conscious of your actions whereever you are. With each of your excercises it evolves – every time when you are attentive. 

What many people struggle with you can learn in a playful way. Smagotcha teaches you to direct your focus on your surroundings and to keep it there – without getting distracted.

__Stay up to date!__ Check out our [blog](/blog) to see all of what's happening with SmagOtcha. A big part of it is the project journey I am undertaking as I travel through Europe building community!

Currently we are developing a beta version for the smartphone app Smagotcha. Our aim is to empower people with mindfulness. We are a small team scattered around Europe.

We want to send a focussed message so we keep our project free of advertisement. We all work voluntary and still rely on money to pay things such as the website, the app development and travel costs. If you want to support us with a donation you would be highly appreciated.

<!--The smartphone app Smagotcha supports its users to understand their own interactions with their environment. For this purpose a cute but disciplined creature made of light matures inside the app and changes its brightness over time. It brings the users thoughts, feelings and sensations into the present moment. In order to accomplish this it evolves its appearance and character continuously – entirely individually and for as long as it is played with. Beware though, it is threatened to atrophy when the old habits resurface. When its luminosity is fully developed, the users will glide into the next phase. There they will be awaited by new secrets in order to let their creature live even more individually.-->
