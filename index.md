Imagine there is a creature made of light, and this creature gives you the opportunity to be more conscious of your actions wherever you are. And with each of your exercises, it evolves - every time you choose to be aware.

What many people struggle with you can learn to do in a playful way. Smagotcha teaches you to direct your focus on your surroundings and to keep it there - with no distractions.

__This is a beta website!__ <br>
Currently we are looking for a website developer who can bring Smagotcha to the next level. If you feel interested in the above description don't hesitate to contact us via info@smagotcha.net or on our facebook channel.

<!--The smartphone app Smagotcha supports its users to understand their own interactions with their environment. For this purpose a cute but disciplined creature made of light matures inside the app and changes its brightness over time. It brings the users thoughts, feelings and sensations into the present moment. In order to accomplish this it evolves its appearance and character continuously â€“ entirely individually and for as long as it is played with. Beware though, it is threatened to atrophy when the old habits resurface. When its luminosity is fully developed, the users will glide into the next phase. There they will be awaited by new secrets in order to let their creature live even more individually.-->
